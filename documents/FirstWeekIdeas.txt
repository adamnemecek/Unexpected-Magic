Idea: pixel-spaceship-guitarhero/”hit the notes”-multiplayer

Game where (one or) multiple players play a song map together by hitting controls according to the notes shown. Each player controls their own harmony. 
The graphics are pixel art-inspired. Something flies around moving between the notes according to the player’s input, for example a spaceship.
4 - 6 oct

Ideas for further development: 
Achievements/combos, note streak
More than one map
Other controls ex. Smartphone
Cooperative mode - Competitive mode
Navigation to note
Different instruments?? → different control layout 
Powerups, attack items, like mario kart
